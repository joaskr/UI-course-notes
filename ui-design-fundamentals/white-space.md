# â–« White space

### Definition

White space = the **empty areas** in a user interface. Known also as **negative space.** Everything around content and components.

### When to apply?

It should be applied based on four factors:

1. Space availability - depends on the viewport width - less on a phone, more on a desktop; space availability can cascade - there's white space on the page but also inside of a component
2. The number of components - how many components are we dealing with?&#x20;
3. Alignment - how you apply the white space needs to be considerate of the alignment - gives structure - can make visual order&#x20;
4. Consistency - for example, symmetry within components - same space on left and right
