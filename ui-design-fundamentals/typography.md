### Areas

* Tracking (space between letters) - adjusts the letter spacing uniformly over a range of characters.
  * Wider tracking is used on titles, labels and watermarks
  * Usually, it's best to stick with the default tracking
  * Usage example:\
    ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)
* Leading (space between lines of text - pronounced with /e - leding/)
  * Should be consistent across similar elements
  * Example:\
    ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)
* Font styles (serif, sans serif, script)
  * Sans serif - very simple letter style, minimal decoration, often used on websites
  * Serif - decorations on letters, traditionally seen as professional
  * Serif and sans serif can be mixed - for example on headers and content paragraphs
  * You shouldn't mix too many styles
* Font weight
  * Adds visual hierarchy
  * Don't make too many words bold - use sparingly
  * Thin fonts may work on large font sizes and high contrast but can be illegible on smaller font sizes\
