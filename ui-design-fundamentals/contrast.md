# ðŸ”² Contrast

### Definition

Contrast helps **separate elements** from each other by adjusting colour, brightness and/or opacity

As a design principle, contrast is all about using opposites to **capture your audienceâ€™s attention** and draw the eye to key parts of the message.

### When to apply?

It should be applied based on two factors:

1. Is it type? If so, is it text they need to read?
2. If it's not type, is it an important visual element?

#### Ad. 1 - Type

Type-based contrast should be applied given the following:

1. How large is the type?
2. Should it be readable? - for example, a watermark isn't integral so it can have little contrast.&#x20;
3.  Does it adhere to the [WCAG Contrast Guidelines](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/#sc143)?

    * Small text (AA) should have a 4.5:1 ratio
    * Small text (AAA) should have a 7:1 ratio
    * Large text (AA) should have a 3:1 ratio
    * Large text (AAA) should have a 4.5:1 ratio

    The higher ratio on the left side means that it's going to have more contrast. \
    **AAA** - more important, needs to be visible\
    **Large text** - 14 points and bold or larger, or 18 points or larger\
    The larger something is, the easier it's to see it so the contrast doesn't need to be that high\
